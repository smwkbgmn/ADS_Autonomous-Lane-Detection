"""
Lane Keeping Assist System (LKAS)

High-level wrapper that provides complete LKAS functionality with a single, simple interface.
Encapsulates both detection and decision systems behind an easy-to-use API.

This is the highest level of abstraction - perfect for integration with vehicles or simulations.
